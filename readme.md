Some sample app (WIP) built with TDD ......

## Overview

The app is going to be a sort of a listing app. Think of it as a listing app for some handmade crafts.

- Users can login/register (password-less login).
- Users can post items of stuff.
- Users can delete stuffs. See 2.
- Users can follow other users.
- Users have a profile page.

> This app is sorely incomplete. I only get to work on this for less than 2 hours a day. It's a personal improvement app, remember ?. It is "not the next usable app" say ___Laravel spark___.

### Hey Yo, where is the (G)UI ? 
There currently isn't no GUI and ___i don't think there'd be one in the future___. I am just taking TDD for a test drive.

### If there is not a (G)UI, how do i know the app works ? 
Run `phpunit --testdox` then read everything in the `tests`.
